Residualising reading times (e.g., from a self-paced reading experiment) can assist in factoring out extraneous noise. For instance, it's useful for helping to factor out reading time effects that might arise independently due to chunk length and position.

residualised_times.R is a script that can be adapted and used to residualise reading times in R. A dummy dataset (your_anon_data.csv) is included to show how the script is applied.

If you use this script, please cite it: CITATION.cff.
